## Project Description üöÄ
The TEA Merida eCommerce backend stands out as the essential core that drives the eCommerce platform specialising in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families. This unique initiative not only focuses on offering products specifically designed to meet the needs and preferences of people with ASD, but goes further by providing a valuable opportunity for collaboration and support for the cause.

Our work is highlighted by the development of an eCommerce that stands out for its commitment to inclusion. In addition to carefully selected products to improve the quality of life for people with ASD, we also offer items that are not made by the families of people with ASD. This strategy not only broadens the scope and diversity of products available, but also creates a platform for families to actively contribute and collaborate with the organisation.

We invite families of people with ASD to participate in the creation and sale of products, providing a unique opportunity to share their skills and experiences, and to receive support from the users who visit the online shop with their purchase or their own collaboration. As every purchase made not only benefits the end users, but also directly supports these families, thus strengthening the community and raising awareness of ASD.

TEA Merida's backend has been meticulously designed to handle the complexity of TEA-focused eCommerce. From inventory management to shipping logistics, every aspect has been tailored to ensure a seamless shopping experience focused on the specific needs of our customers. In short, the TEA Merida eCommerce backend is not only the technological backbone that facilitates online transactions, it is also the driving force behind an inclusive community and a movement that seeks to make a positive difference in the lives of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families.
Join us on this journey of support, inclusion and growth!
